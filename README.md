Language detection is the process of identifying the language in which a given text or document is written. It can evaluate text and return a language identifier that indicates the language a document was written in.
<h2>ABOUT</h2>

**What is the language detection?**

Language detection is one of the features offered by Azure AI Language, a collection of machine learning and AI algorithms in the cloud for developing intelligent applications that involve written language.
Language detection can detect the language a document is written in, and returns a language code for a wide range of languages, variants, dialects, and some regional/cultural languages.



**Importance of language detection**

1. It helps tailor content, websites, and product descriptions to the language preferences of specific regions or demographics.
2. This makes the user experience more seamless and user-friendly, reducing bounce rates and improving user satisfaction.
3. In the field of sentiment analysis and social media monitoring, language detection is crucial for tracking and analyzing global trends and opinions.
4. Language detection  helps maintain a safe and respectful online environment.
5. It enables businesses and organizations to reach a broader audience, improve communication, and make data-driven decisions across linguistic and cultural boundaries.

<h2>TECHNOLOGIES USED</h2>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/kamesh0407/stock_market_prediction/blob/main/InteloneAPI.jpg" width="400" height="240" >
</p>

The [Intel® OneAPI toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/toolkits.html#gs.3btkxe), [Intel® oneDAL toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/openvino-toolkit/overview.html) enables models to be trained in a more efficient way and results in faster training times.As this is a problem of multiclass classification, so I will be using the Multinomial Naïve Bayes algorithm to train the language detection model.





<h2>METHODOLOGY</h2>
<li>It measures the proportion of correctly identified languages out of all the samples tested. High accuracy indicates that the language detection system is effective in correctly identifying languages.
</li>
<li>  language detection aims to provide a robust and objective assessment of the performance of language detection systems.</li>
<li> It helps researchers and developers identify areas for improvement and choose the most suitable algorithms and models for specific applications, ensuring accurate and reliable language identification.</li>
<br/>


<h2>PLATFORMS</h2>


**CODES IN DIFFERENT PLATFORMS:**

Language detection contains data about 22 popular languages and contains 1000 sentences in each of the languages, so it will be an appropriate dataset for training a language detection model with machine learning.
